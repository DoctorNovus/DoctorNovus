# ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm **DoctorNovus** otherwise known as **Hiro**. ðŸ‘‹
Hello! Iâ€™m Hiro, a dedicated and innovative software engineer with a passion for creating impactful, user-centric digital solutions. Currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science, I bring a rich blend of technical skills and industry experience from roles in web development, app development, and full-stack engineering. As the founder of Ottegi, a web development company focused on affordable and custom software solutions for small businesses, Iâ€™m committed to helping clients achieve a strong, effective online presence.

In addition to leading Ottegi, I enjoy teaching as a programming instructor, where I help others build confidence and skills in coding. My journey has included hands-on experience with various technologies, including Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and React, alongside a commitment to continuous growth and giving back to the tech community.
